# C++ & Algorithmic Foundations 🏆

This repository documents my two-year journey competing in the **Cyprus Olympiad in Informatics (COI)**. It tracks my evolution from basic C++ syntax to becoming a **two-year national finalist**.

### 🧠 The Competitive Mindset
While I reached the national finals in Competitive Programming (CP), I see these challenges as a "mental gym" rather than my end goal. This journey taught me how to:
* **Optimize for Performance:** Writing code that runs in milliseconds using advanced data structures.
* **Think Under Pressure:** Solving complex logical puzzles within strict time limits.
* **Master C++ Fundamentals:** Deep diving into memory management, pointers, and the Standard Template Library (STL).

### 🎯 My True Passion: Visuals & Networking
To be realistic, I prefer engineering over abstract puzzles. I am most driven when I can **see** my code in action and when systems **communicate** across a network. I am currently bridging my COI algorithmic background with:
* **Real-Time Visuals:** Building game engine architectures and data visualizations.
* **Networking:** Architecting server-side logic and distributed systems.

### 🛠️ Skills & Algorithms Mastered
Through the COI, I developed a strong grasp of:
* **Data Structures:** Segment Trees, Graphs, DSU, and Heaps.
* **Algorithms:** Dynamic Programming (DP), Dijkstra’s, BFS/DFS, and Greedy approaches.
* **Complexity Analysis:** Ensuring solutions meet $O(N \log N)$ or $O(N)$ requirements.

### 📈 Achievements
* **2x Finalist:** Cyprus Olympiad in Informatics.
* **Algorithmic Foundation:** Applying these logical patterns to my current work in **Game Engines** and **Maritime ML**.
